- 👋 Hi, I'm Flor.
- 👀 I'm interested in IT.
- 🦾 I currently work as a career coach and have a background as an IT recruiter. I am also a volunteer in the Argentinian Society of Artificial Intelligence (SAIA) in the people team.
- 🌱 I am about to start a Data Science course in March 2024.
- 🤓 While I have some knowledge in Data Studio and Power BI, I haven't had the opportunity to practice them yet.
- 💞️ I'm curious and a bit of a nerd, which led me to take courses on gamification and effective communication after graduating with a degree in Psychology from the University of Buenos Aires.
- 📫 You can reach me at fechezarreta@soyhenry.com or florencia.echezarreta@saia.ar.
